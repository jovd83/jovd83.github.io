C.R.A.F.T.,"Context, Role, Action, Format, Target. A comprehensive framework that ensures clarity and repeatability by defining who the AI is, what it should do, and for whom.","Use this for professional, high-stakes tasks where you need a reliable, structured output (e.g., blog posts, business emails, reports).",https://bacoach.nl/2025/11/prompt-engineering-craft-framework/,[Framework],/img/prompt_frameworks/c_r_a_f_t_.png
CoT (Chain of Thought),Encourages the LLM to explain its reasoning step-by-step before giving a final answer. often triggered by adding 'Let's think step by step'.,"Essential for complex logic, math problems, or reasoning tasks where the AI might otherwise jump to an incorrect conclusion.",https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/chain-of-thoughts,[Technique],/img/prompt_frameworks/cot__chain_of_thought_.png
Few-Shot Prompting,Providing a few examples (shots) of the input and desired output to 'train' the model on the specific pattern you want.,"Use when you need a specific format, style, or when the task is unique and difficult to explain with instructions alone.",https://www.promptingguide.ai/techniques/fewshot,[Technique],/img/prompt_frameworks/few_shot_prompting.png
C.R.I.S.P.E.,"Context, Role, Instruction, Style, Personalization, Examples. A detailed framework for crafting highly customized and persona-driven responses.","C.R.I.S.P.E. is a good choice for technical and coding tasks. This framework is particularly strong when you need the LLM to follow specific constraints (""Specification"") and provide concrete examples (""Example"") to guide the output.",https://sourcingdenis.medium.com/crispe-prompt-engineering-framework-e47eaaf83611,[Framework],/img/prompt_frameworks/c_r_i_s_p_e_.png
S.C.O.P.E.,"Situation, Context, Objective, Parameters, Examples. Focuses on defining the business scenario and strict boundaries.","SCOPE is particularly effective for business and strategic tasks because the Parameters section consolidates constraints, formatting, and audience into a single, rigid guardrail.",https://medium.com/@rgothlin/5-detailed-examples-of-how-to-master-the-scope-framework-9b8d333131d0,[Framework],/img/prompt_frameworks/s_c_o_p_e_.png
C.O.S.T.A.R.,"Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response. A granular framework that separates 'Style' (writing structure) from 'Tone' (emotion).",Great for content creation where the nuance of the voice (Tone) and the structure of the text (Style) need to be controlled separately. C.O.S.T.A.R. is a good choice for Creative/Business Writing,https://portkey.ai/blog/what-is-costar-prompt-engineering/,[Framework],/img/prompt_frameworks/c_o_s_t_a_r_.png
R.T.F.,"RTF (Role, Task, Format) is the ""Speed"" framework. It is concise and direct. Because it lacks specific sections for ""Context"" or ""Audience,"" those details must be heavily integrated into the Task section to ensure the output remains high-quality.","Perfect for quick, everyday queries where speed is more important than deep complexity.",https://fvivas.com/en/rtf-framework-prompts-llm/,[Framework],/img/prompt_frameworks/r_t_f_.png
